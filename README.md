- simple bio
I’m Mohosinin Islam, a 24-year-old Computer Science and Engineering student at Southeast University. I’m passionate about programming, networking, web development, and artificial intelligence. I know languages like C++, C, and Java, and I’m currently learning web development to expand my skills.
In my free time, I love gaming, playing cricket, and kicking around a football—they help me stay active and keep my mind fresh. My goal is to become a networking or AI engineer and work on creative solutions that make a difference. I’m the kind of person who sees mistakes as stepping stones, always learning and growing with every challenge that comes my way.
